# Introdcution

## Project's purpose
The core purpose of this project is to assess and utilize features offered by [Open Cluster Manager](./chapters/02_tech-stack.md). Our primary goal is to come up with a simple (yet covering the most important capabilities) case study. The workflow will include brainstorming the idea, creating an environment in which the assessment will be conducted, deployment of the actual demo and documentation covering the development process.
