# Case study concept description

We highlight following key features of OCM that we find worth investigating within scope of this case study:<br>
* Cluster registering aka "double opt-in handshaking"
    + Ensuring safe cluster authorization is crucial in order to meet some compliance requirements.
* Dynamic resource management and scalability
    + Cloud services usually do not have constant demand levels. Dynamically allocating resources due to spikes in traffic is critical.
* Availability and fault recovery
    + Identifying behavior of klusterlets during simulated hub maintenance/termination.
