Case Study Concept: Exploring Operational Cluster Management (OCM) Features for a Bookstore Service


The application under consideration is a bookstore service comprising three components:

* Website: This component serves as the landing page and hosts static content related to the bookstore.
* Shopping UI: A Single Page Application (SPA) built using Vue.js, providing an intuitive and interactive shopping interface for users.
* Shopping API: This component functions as a RESTful JSON API, catering to the needs of the Shopping UI. It interfaces with a MySQL database to facilitate shopping experiences for customers.


We highlight following key features of OCM that we find worth investigating within the context of the aforementioned bookstore service:<br>

* Ensuring Safe Cluster Authorization: Compliance requirements demand robust cluster authorization mechanisms. Safeguarding sensitive data and meeting regulatory standards necessitate thorough investigation into secure cluster authorization protocols.

* Dynamic Resource Management and Scalability: Cloud services experience fluctuating demand levels, requiring dynamic resource allocation to handle traffic spikes efficiently. Leveraging the Placement API enables the dynamic selection of managed clusters and workload deployment, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability.
* Availability, Fault Recovery, and Application Migration:
    + Cluster Maintenance and Shutdown Handling: OCM is anticipated to facilitate the management of cluster maintenance and shutdown events through strategies such as automated failover and load balancing. The investigation will focus on whether OCM can orchestrate the rerouting of traffic to healthy clusters during scheduled maintenance or unexpected shutdowns, aiming to ensure uninterrupted service availability. Additionally, the investigation will assess OCM's ability to monitor cluster health and trigger automated recovery processes to potentially mitigate downtime and minimize impact on the bookstore application.
    + Migration to New Application Versions: The investigation will explore how OCM can streamline the process of migrating the application to new versions by leveraging the Placement API for workload orchestration. The focus will be on determining if OCM can dynamically select target clusters based on resource availability and deployment policies when deploying updated versions of the application. If feasible, the investigation aims to understand how OCM could automate the migration process to potentially minimize service disruption and ensure a smooth transition to the new application version. Additionally, the investigation will explore the possibility of OCM providing rollback capabilities to revert to previous versions in case of unforeseen issues, with the goal of mitigating risks associated with application migration.
